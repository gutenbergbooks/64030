        MY VALUED RUBY




        THE STAR OF LIBERIA


    Oh! my mighty love, for my people, friends,
    But there’s a certain class of us that our minds doesn’t blend,
    Though we’ve fought many a battle and it seems we’ve always won,
    But we’ll be greater when the “Star of Liberia” shines like the sun.
    I have sat and dreamed and to come there’s a brighter day,
    But if our race pride’s weak, and we have no love, just
         when I’m afraid to say.

    You pattern after the white man in every way but one,
    And that’s why the “Star of Liberia” cannot shine like the sun.
    We must learn to pull together, because animals know that much,
    For when we seesaw back and forth into our future it puts a clutch.
    This must be stopped or our defeat will be like the Huns,
    And it keeps the “Star of Liberia” from shining like the sun.
    I see a ship on the ocean at a distance of a thousand miles
    And it’s flying a flag of a people that will be prominent afterwhile.

    There’s a tiny bit of a star that’s causing that flag to fly,
    But with a close observation it can be seen with the natural eye.
    We must love this flag above all things we’ve done,
    For it holds the “Star of Liberia” that’s going to shine like the sun.
    This ship has good omen and a cloudy day there’s none,
    Then why keep the “Star of Liberia” from shining like the sun.
    We know she’s cruised the ocean for fifty years or more,
    But as soon as we pull together she will land on the American shores.




        DEFENSE


    Colored men stop your marriages
    To women of the other race,
    Quit breaking the hearts of our goodly women
    And bringing them a shameful face,
    Why are some of us thoughtless
    Upon things along this line,
    Why when you go out of this race to marry
    You leave women just as fine.
    Now colored men I’m pleading this case
    For our worthy colored girls
    And trying to stop this awful horror
    That’s passing through this world.
    Where do you find other women
    That will be yoked along you’re side,
    To help you sail life’s rough ocean,
    No matter how rigid the tide.
    They go with you through thick and thin,
    Down on their knees upon kitchen floors,
    And in wash tubs they tirelessly bend
    Just to help climb the ladder of fame.
    Then could you discard an honest soul
    That another race may honor your name?
    Now God in heaven wrote
    This humble oration,
    That we may form a grand
    And noble nation.




        LOVE’S PRECAUTION


    Trespass not
    Upon two hearts that love,
    Your penalty’s imposed,
    By the Savior above.

    This tiny little link
    That connects two hearts,
    With the watchword,
    That no one should tear apart.

    Think some day
    It may be you,
    Then read this poem
    ’Twill tell more true.

    It will explain my mind
    Just as I write,
    And the sorrow that hangs,
    O’er me tonight.

    I’m driven away from the one that held me
    The smooth love, on the roughest sea,
    Now this is a teaching
    To us one and all,

    That true love grows
    Summer, winter, and fall.
    Through sunshine and showers,
    In gardens of Mayflowers.

    And o’er the desert land
    No distance can break it.
    ’Tis found as we make it,
    True love for ever, stands.




        ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF LIFE


    There’s only one way
    That we’re to abide
    Then the way to success,
    Is very wide
    On the sunny side of life.

    Each moment in the day
    We should wear a smile,
    It brings so-called good luck
    And it’s really worth while
    On the sunny side of life.

    The roses that bloom,
    That scents the air
    No place they grow
    And look more fair
    Than on the sunny side of life.

    If we live right
    And omit all sin,
    Our days will be bright
    From the beginning to the end
    On the sunny side of life.

    Even all the joy, and happiness too,
    With God’s heavenly blessings,
    For our deeds, kind and true,
    Is on the sunny side of life.




        EIGHT NOBLEMEN


    Above my bed
    Hangs eight noble heads,
    With love, might and grace,
    They brought honor to their race.

    Dunbar could take you
    To a land of beauty; it seems
    And shine the light upon nature
    To let you read his poetical dreams.

    Douglass as a statesman
    Thronged the whole wide world,
    And always in our memory
    He’ll shine just like a pearl.

    Attuck’s patriotism
    For the land of the noble and free,
    God bless him on his way,
    And strengthen his mind with such decree.

    Taylor, the lovely musician,
    Rhythmically to you could bring
    The sweetness in his music
    Was like the bird that sings.

    Tanner showed his art,
    When fate painted his heart.
    He traveled in a whirl
    And works exhibited to the world.

    Dumas,
    The author,
    Showed his fame,
    And down the honor roll
    We should always find his name.

    Washington, the humble but famous Booker T.
    Had many ups and downs,
    Though hardship he never feared,
    And from the cruel world he gained a crown.




        MY RUBY MONTROSE


    Down in Illinois around among the boys
    I never had a chance to go to school,
    For there was my dear mother and little invalid brother
    And I was their support as a rule.
    But soon come the end to pass them on high
    There hung saddest memories to the old home was good-bye,
    Then with all my ups and downs, there’s one true friend I found.
    While I sit a dreaming of the bygone days
    Then a hidden voice did swell, saying I’ll teach you how to spell,
    For there’s a tender meaning for each letter in my name.


        CHORUS

    R--is for the right, I’ll try to teach you my boy.
    U--means the union that our hearts will enjoy.
    B--is used in blotting sorrow’s memory, too.
    Y--is that your yearning heart will always be true.
    M--is for the million times you wanted to go to school.
    O--shows how this old world treats when mother’s lying cool.
    N--is for my natural love to you I plainly give.
    T--is just to teach us how to love and live.
    The placing of these letters tells how the story goes.
    And the only name I love and spell is my Ruby Montrose.

    All through life you’ll be like a pearl to me,
    Just to have and hold you for my own;
    With tender love, so great, then our lives I will relate,
    And dream of you my dear when I’m alone.
    Nights I’ll always pray that you may see the day
    When you won’t be afraid to spell your name.
    We’ll study night and day, this will help you on your way,
    And relieve your tender heart of its bashful pain.
    To me then came my trial and it seemed if heaven smiled
    On those dear sweet letters that spells her name.




        A LIFELONG HAPPINESS


    Time promised me
    Some day to unfold
    A lifelong happiness
    Bound with a goal.
    I’m patiently awaiting
    Along the way,
    Attentive as a child
    At its daily play.
    My heart ne’er chills
    From the long winter’s cold.
    It’s wanting that happiness
    Bound with a goal.
    At times I’m sad
    With nothing to say,
    I should be gay as a rose
    Of a bright summer’s day.
    But looking for the story
    So sweet to be told
    Are you my little happiness
    Bound with a goal?
    If fate takes away
    This promise so dear,
    There’ll be a chain
    Of my wasted years.
    Link by link
    To count and hold,
    Trying to find my happiness
    Bound with a goal.




        THE EVILS OF ALCOHOL


    Once more around and I’ll go home,
    It’s really a shame how I’ve learned to roam.
    Oh! but what’s the use? I’ve got a good excuse
    That outnumber the bubbles in this glass.
    Ah, ah, ah, ah, drink up, boys, and do it fast,
    For with your old pal it may be the last.
    You wonder why I have this knife?
    Yes, I got it, got it just to kill my wife;
    It’s the only thing for me to do,
    Since fate brings about that she’s not true,
    Stop, oh, don’t coax me, friends,
    You can see I’m near my end.
    Now you shoved me over that chair
    And I’ve seen the time you wouldn’t dare;
    But that’s when bloomed the rose of my life
    And I had the love of my sweet wife.
    Now think, it was stolen, by a dirty cur,
    And in my life it’s put a blur.
    Yes, I’m the guy that lives next door,
    Where my crying babe sits on the floor.
    Wait; I’m going to that swell cafe,
    My wife’s there, and lead astray.
    Ah! this is your secret place to dine.
    And for me, ’twasn’t hard to find,
    Why not let me meet your friend?
    He’s beneath the notice of cultured men.
    Ah! that’s the Italian that carried the note,
    And he would meet death if I could clutch his throat.
    Me no caree letter no time,
    Me com a dis a placa, drinka Italiana wine.
    Shut up, don’t you dare to speak,
    You’re part of the cause, you dirty sneak.
    Ah! and here’s the Jew that hauled your trunk,
    And the boat that brought him over really should have sunk.
    Oh! Meister, vate, vate you speak to me rongs,
    I spyed in this yard an o’ pair tongs.
    Who’s that Chinaman? I guess he cooked the meal,
    And he will land in glory quick as I can grab this steel,
    Woo Long, Sing Lee, Fong Low,
    Well, old man, I’ll spare your head,
    For in that language I don’t know what you said.
    Me noee cookee disee placee,
    Me gotee laundry, washee lacee.
    Ask your friend to buy me a drink;
    Ah! thanks old pal, but I called you a slink.
    What! is she crying,
    She’s thinking of our lives, that’s very trying.
    Oh! now I know just what she sees
    A once happy husband and living good as you please,
    There’s a painting in her memory, how I hated drink and gamble;
    And how I spent my evenings home, for I had no mind to ramble.
    Then along come you, another suited man,
    But she being weak, like the most of us, prosperity she couldn’t stand,
    Then I took to this drug
    ’Cause it eased the nerves in my head,
    And ever since I’ve wished that she and I both were dead.
    Ah! let go of my throat, don’t let him, me boys,
    Let go of my throat, I tell you.
    Oh! mercy,
    There’s my little babe, her voice calls,
    But woman and liquor is the cause of it all.




        THE SUNSHINE OF YESTERDAY


    Where goeth the sunshine of beautiful yesterday,
    When breezes blew light and all nature was gay.
    Now the birds are mute and refuse to sing,
    But down twinkles the snow to make the sleigh bells ring
    I’ll ask a simple question of you one and all,
    Where goeth the sunshine when the snow begins to fall?




        GINGER BAY OUTING


    Hush your mouth, don’t say a word,
    Let me tell the good news I heard.
    There’s going to be an outing soon
    Down where folks spend their honeymoon.
    Its given by the Dark Town club,
    And they serve chicken by the tub;
    Another thing their music’s grand,
    Drums, piano, and old tin pans,
    Get your ticket and don’t be late,
    Be at the landing prompt at eight.

    Listen! listen! what’s all that noise
    Everybody’s going to Ginger Bay.
    There’s old Raz Jones with his slide trombone
    And you can hear him play it for miles away.
    Come on boy we’ll have some time,
    There’ll be lots of swell dancing,
    And they’ll serve you wine,
    And if the boat begins to rock
    Keep right on dancing, if you lose your frock,
    Be careful what you do
    When you get a drink or two.
    And when the boat pulls into land
    Take your partner by the hand
    And waltz her off at Ginger Bay.




        MY WIFE


    My wife, oh! my wife,
    Was taught that game of cooking
    Some time early in her life.
    Its just as easy
    For her to cook a good meal
    As it is for you to ride
    In an automobile.
    It seems that it’s her pride
    To fix good eats,
    Such as roast pork and candied sweet tatoes,
    And apple pies, she can’t be beat.
    I can be so mad when I walk in,
    Lips all shot out,
    Hanging down on my chin,
    But the essence of that food
    Says why be thou so rude.
    Then henceforth and forever
    May thy grin.
    If you can keep from smiling
    When my wife makes apple pies,
    That’s more than I can do.
    She only makes that kind
    That melts on the tongue
    And passes by the thorax so easy,
    Till it makes the pallet hum.
    Telling the epiglottis
    That it don’t have to move
    Cause in this pie am plenty lard
    And sure am short and smooth.
    My Adam’s apple never works
    When I go to swallow;
    All the muscles in my neck
    Never touch my collar.
    Then it reaches the bottom of my heart
    And sounds the tune of joy
    And kills that word O’ Hunger
    When I’m penniless so often annoys.
    Now if you can keep from smiling
    When my wife makes apple pies
    That’s more than I can do.

        FATE AND TIME


    Fate taken away my world of goal
    Time sees that I grow old,
    Just these two words, which is time and fate,
    Where art thou love, that turned to hate?

    But wait tell I tolger bout dat gravy dey had roun dat possom.
    It was gist a real medium lite broun,
    Hum youm, youm! when dey rised de lid yo could smill it all ober toun.
    An dat homade cake stood five layers hi,

    Den dey passed de water mellin an ice kream on de side,
    An’ when you backed away from dat table yo sho was satisfied.
    But you oder seen um a pitin on airs,

    But I aint so buzy wid dis prawh dat I can’t see dat
         sister slipen biscuits up her sleeve. Amen.




        WHAT WE OUGHT TO KNOW


    God help a people that really has no flag,
    For on their present and future seems to heavily swag,
    ’Tis that awful burden of mystery,
    And oh! how painful that their heroism’s ne’er mentioned in history.
    Then go my brave people and make one of your own,
    It will show our mighty love and that we’re learning to stand alone.
    For years and years you’ve given your sons to this
         land of the noble and free,
    But maybe it’ll go down in this last war, though
         others we’ve failed to see,
    Now we have men among us, men of brain and might,
    Don’t dream of difficulty a few years back, for then
         all newspapers were white.

    Now why not send our reporters on to the battlefield
    And let them follow our comrades so their great deeds cannot be shield,
    And when the shots and shells are flying
    Into the hearts of our loved ones dying
    Then God helps a people that try to help themselves
    That has the right love for each other laid on memory’s golden shelves.
    Just think of our great heroes that died that we may live,
    And think what it’s stealing from our children because
         history fails to give.
    I’ve even spoke of Honorable Douglass to boys of my race,
    Why they would ask me who was Douglass and amazingly look into my face,
    Oh! this would break my heart to think of that noble man,
    And there are others that should be in all history of the land.

        THE PARSON’S RESOLUTION


    Parson Johnson at his church on a New Year’s Eve
    Made a resolution he had up his sleeve,
    He knew the congregation had some inside information,
    But from where cometh he never knew,
    So the bells begin to ring and the whistles begin to blow
    Everybody kneeled in prayer, but Parson walked the flo.


        CHORUS

    Said, Lord! remove those evil spirits, that’s concealed in my trunk,
    In which so often I bathe my soul, but never was I drunk.
    Deliver me along a different path and close mine eyes
         even to an empty flask.
    And if temptation greets me along my way
    May Thee never let bad thoughts upon my conscience play.

    Parson in his sermon, done oh! very well,
    He spoke of hypocrites, backsliders and infidels,
    He mentioned of St. Peter, who is writing the deeds we do
    And said when sliding back is untrue.
    He preached until his mind was a little overtaxed
    And knowing that bottle he had hid was the real old true facts.




        ON SUNDAY MORN


    Long side de road
    Where my heart overflowed,
    From de moanen uv a dove
    While I’s dreamin’ uv yo love
                    On Sunday morn.

    While I sit an thing uv yo,
    And de sun shines doun on de mistic’s dew,
    In dis beautiful place,
    I kin see yo sweet face
                    On Sunday morn.

    I love to roam de putty wile wood,
    It reminds me uv our dearest childhood,
    To listen to de birds
    And music widout word
                    On Sunday morn.

    Ef fate holds a day we’re to meet again
    To relieve my heart uv its aken pain,
    If it’s God’s decree
    I hope it will be
                    On Sunday morn.




        TOAST


    Leave me not dear just now,
    The words I solemnly vow.
    Without your care
    This world I fear,
    I’ll take a glass of little bubbles
    Then life will be full of troubles.




        MY LITTLE GIRL


    Your smiles have faded into frowns,
    Your eyes have lost their glow of brown,
    Your lips are numb, hides your teeth of pearl,
    Why lose this beauty, my little girl?

    The roses in the garden, are drooping and dying
    Since they know of your tears and sighing,
    This puts a crape o’er the whole wide world
    Bring back this beauty, my little girl.

    I listen to the birds when I’m alone
    And they have lost their silver tone;
    Sometimes they’re mute, and feathers all curled,
    There’s another beauty lost, my little girl.

    Now the sun came up but refused to shine,
    It was lost from your presence and love divine,
    The clouds drifted by, fastly in a whirl,
    I want you and the sunshine, my little girl.

    There was a day that was dear to me
    When we sailed across loves bright sea,
    There we saw only water, sky and love
    And this was a blessing from our God above
    But soon our boat ran into a snirl,
    And gone was our beauty, my little girl.




        A POET’S WIFE


    Has a miserable life
    As he sits and thinks from sun to sun,
    There he dreams of the lakes and dells
    Her poor heart just beats by spells.
    But when he’s back from those beautiful scenes
    She looks in his eyes and the love-light gleams.




        A FROSTY MORN


    Spring’s early blossoms
    Are sleeping in their grave,
    Oh! how the sun did shine,
    For their lives it tried to save.

    Just think of all their beauty
    And Jack Frost was the winner,
    Though in sight of the shining sun,
    He’s an awful sinner.

    And while they lie asleep
    Beneath the chilly snow,
    We only dream of their tenderness
    And their fragrance we love so.

    Just think of each little petal
    That was veiled with that all white shroud,
    And the miserable death they died,
    While the sun was behind the clouds.

    But cheer up! all sad hearts,
    Mother nature is soon to bring
    Another collection of buds,
    For the ones stolen this spring.




        THE LITTLE TOE DANCER


    Down a little lane
    So beautifully shaded
    There I met the queen
    Of all little maidens.

    Her hair was light
    And eyes sky-blue,
    She was out of the garden
    Of beauties that’s true.

    She’d hold her little dress
    And dance to the breeze;
    She would do it with grace
    And musical ease.

    On the tips of her toes
    She’d go around like a top,
    With such dancing, entrancing,
    I thought she’d ne’er stop.

    Then she’d bow
    And give a sweet little smile,
    Pulling her finger
    Like a real little child.

    But who only knows
    Whom this maiden can be,
    She’s my secret inspirer,
    And the world to me.

    Sometimes when I write
    She stands by my side,
    If my poem’s of the ocean
    She rides on the tide.

    Now little one
    My thoughts are dim,
    But with your guidance
    I worked with vim.

    And now I must go,
    But my thoughts are of you.
    We’ll meet here next Sunday
    In the lane at two.




        A SPARK OF LOVE


    What will ease
    Two aching hearts
    That fate and time
    Has drifted apart?
    I’ll speak to this rose,
    For maybe it knows
    A gladness for her love
    That’s now reposed.
    Why did our minds
    With spirited souls,
    Let distance ring in
    Leaving our hearts grow cold?
    Now we sit and dream
    Though miles away,
    Neither can enjoy
    The blessings of the day.
    For a moment we’re happy
    Then sadness prevails,
    In our ears whistles memories
    Like a nightingale.




        THE DEATH OF MRS. WORMSLEY


    Down along Lincoln way,
    In our church on Sabbath day
    A shock to a father, sisters and brothers,
    When the Master called the Wormsley mother.
    Tear drops then began to fall,
    But this is the sting must come to us all,
    With a pitiful look, one at the other,
    To mourn the death of the Wormsley mother.
    Soon the alarm spread around,
    And hung a sad token o’er the town,
    The alarm traveled farther and farther,
    While the heaven’s doors opened to Wormsley mother.




        EASTER ROSES

(To Mrs. Perry Honce McGee)


    The roses you hold
    Though they are withering away,
    In their heart is my love
    And a brighter day.

    Their petals now drooped
    But fragrance still sweet,
    My heart with trueness
    For you ever beats.

    All the whole world
    And its treasures of gold
    Could tell no sweeter story
    Than these roses have told.

    So fate could ne’er send
    No sweeter one, dear,
    Than you with your love
    And tender care.




        EYES


    Eyes that speak
    Are worth their weight in gold.
    For many a aching heart
    With love they console.

    They have no words
    Like the trembling lips,
    Though glance by glance
    You can read their manuscript.




        LAZY MULE


    Gee, Gee,
    Yo better quit dat pestern me.
    Woe, tell I unkiber dis corn,
    A raskul like yo shud nebber ben bon,
    When de sun comes out yo am looken fo de cool
    An’ dat’s de powful acten uv a lazy mule.

    Den dah’s de minet I gits de bridle
    Yo eyes am shut yo mine goes idle.
    Did yo had no risens or go to school--no.
    Ah, dat’s de rezen yo’s a lazy mule.

    Now maybe tumorh I’ll drove yo tu town,
    And what I means yo gwine tu sweep de groun,
    Yo won’t drug along acten a fool,
    Yo’ll git up an muv, lazy mule.

    Yo ets a wagon loder con an’ a bale o hay,
    Den yo leans er ginst de fence when yo goes tu bray,
    I recken som time you’ll ax fo a stool
    So you kin set doun yo lazy mule.

    Den tu I recken I’ll trade yo off,
    Yo lon nekhog, yo ets de hay out de loft,
    Now yo kin git mad but I got er nu rule,
    Yo good for nothen lazy mule.

    And when I goes tu mak dis deal,
    Yo run around de barn an’ kick up yo heal,
    Stah rit sid dat ole marh Brule
    Den de man won’t no he’s giten sich a lazy mule.

    Ah, an when he gits yo you’ll cease tu balk,
    Fo he am goter a chalklin yo has tu walk,
    From dat dah on yo’ll be a liven tool
    Dat I’ll en yo actens uv er lazy mule.

    An mah de dah come when yo cease tu breve
    Den yo’ll flot wid de angles fru de trees,
    An de buzzards will fite one mo duel
    An I’ll sah dah gones de essene uv dat lazy mule.




        THROUGH THE MILL


    If I can compose my way to success
    Then some time I’ll compose the rest,
    It will be of my childhood days
    Building mud houses for different plays.

    Oh! I was bad and mischievous, too,
    And always looking for something to do,
    And when I found nothing I surely was sad,
    To be good very long would make me mad.

    Though I longed to go to school,
    But I was poor and fate overruled,
    Then my mother, whom I love so dear,
    Passed away at the end of the year.

    Then I fought this old, rough world,
    For I had lost my valued pearl.
    And now she sleeps beneath the sod;
    It brought me deep sorrow though it’s the will of God.

    Just think of my mother, she guides me yet,
    And keeps me away from those sinful nets.
    All through life, from place to place,
    She ne’er let alcohol enter my taste.

    And I’ve ne’er lived a day I want to live o’er,
    Unless it was school days which I could love more,
    Now I’ll thank God and that sweet little her,
    My life’s been rough, but never a blur.

    A heart without love
    And nowhere to build,
    The mind wanders far,
    Leaving the soul to chill.




        A DROOPING ROSE


    She’ll always be
    Sweet like the breath you give
    In trying to console me.
    I hope you’re not leaving,
    ’Twould break my heart to think,
    I love you better than all the rest,
    For your petals are all over pink.
    Cheer up! little rose,
    With your petals looking mad,
    My sweet heart is dying,
    That’s why I’m looking sad.
    Oh! there is your companions
    And they are blooming all gay,
    But I wonder if you know
    My love is to pass away,
    But forever in my memory.




        BECKER’S JEALOUSY


    Lody, Lody, chile am yo heard de nues,
    Ole Ruby Gee go dem late stile shoes (no!)
    Yo noes dem kin wid de heel so high,
    An all de men’s jist looks when she goes by,
    Course she ain’t as swell as she thinks she am, ef all ports am true.
    She oder member, dat I noder, when she worned a boot an a shoe.

    An when Ole Ruby Gee comes in church we kin gider one pison frown.
    Oh! but I loves dat uman jist like I loves a snake,
    An I ain’t fogot how tonny she acted don at Ras Johnson’s wake.
    Eber time dey passed de coffee she’d tuck it an kinder linger,
    An put on de mostest airs, posen her little finger.
    Dar she sit an sip, an saped,
    An droped de hol cup in her lap.
    Mursey me, I laughed, tell my sides almos buss,
    Den we had one awful fuss,
    But bleave me, chile, I helt my groun,
    Ef things did look powful dark aroun.

    Well sur we broke up dat wake, widout a dout,

    Den we was quiet where de siety folks lived
    An we hardly drewed our breff,
    But when we’s out uv dat part uv toun I nocked her rite an lef.




        TRUELET


    Each day there is sunshine,
    Each day there are showers,
    Means some day in May Day
    We’ll be picking wild flowers.




        INCH BY INCH


    I’m yet in the path
    A jogging along,
    That’s leading to the righteous
    Away from the wrong.

    We have not time
    To talk evil of others,
    For losing enemies
    To gain heavenly brothers.

    Oh, Lord!
    May the day be long
    In which you have power
    To sound the heavenly gong.

    We know this means
    Our last day,
    Bless us and save us
    In that land far away.




        THE PLACE WHERE LITTLE MARY LIVES


    Down a beautiful country road
    The roses in bloom and their perfume strewed,
    Oh! the joy it brought to my heart,
    ’Twas so tender, so sweet, I couldn ne’er depart
    From that place where little Mary lives.

    Oh! that spot beside the hill
    Where nature and beauty can always build,
    Tells a story it really seems
    And will always be life’s sweetest dream
    Of that place where little Mary lives.

    When she plucked and gave to me
    A beautiful rose in a manner so free,
    The heavenly breezes begin to blow
    And the tenderness through my heart did flow
    For that place where little Mary lives.

    That was a day of God’s decree,
    And oh! no scenes could sweeter be,
    They soothed my heart and eased my pain,
    May the bright sunshine ne’er turn to rain,
    Down where little Mary lives.

    But summer is soon to fade away,
    Followed by a cold winter day.
    The howling winds in the month of December,
    But that dear little rose I’ll always remember
    That come from the place where little Mary lives.

    Now I see the blustery snow
    And it’s changed the scenes where I used to go,
    It’s all over white
    Though the stars are shining bright,
    How sad be that place where little Mary lives.

    At times I think and really sigh
    To think of those roses that are sleeping nearby.
    But they will return
    To my heart that yearns,
    And for that place and its beauty
    Where little Mary lives.




        A QUESTION


    Why are great men’s lives
    Thrown into the mist?
    One’s who aim at the sky,
    Are found at the bottom of the list.




        MR. FINK


    I met a man
    The other day
    On a Chicago train.
    By the way
    His face was strange
    And very old,
    And holds a sad story
    Yet to be told.
    He says, my boy,
    We’ll have a drink.
    I said, no I thank you,
                    Mr. Fink.

    Then he gave a real deep sigh,
    Like a child about to cry.
    In a moment he raised and said,
    Then he stroked his old bald head,
    Patting me on my shoulder then.
    He faded his wrinkles into a grin,
    Now my lad, as I sit and think,
    May you never be like
                    Mr. Fink.

    My younger days had I refused,
    Now I’d stand in different shoes;
    I could throw this blanket off of me
    And this deadly sorrow that you see
    Then with a nod he solemnly winked,
    Try and remember Mr. Fink.

    With a trembling he then relates
    Of his mighty love that’s turned to hate,
    He called a name that was once his wife.
    This was the pride that wrecked his life,
    Saying once I was rich, but now I beg.
    She’s the cause, a wretched old hag,
    Then there was love with a broken link
    Mournfully told by Mr. Fink.




        GRAY HEADS


    Two gray heads bowed in tears,
    Above hung memories of wasted years,
    For once they were young with the blessings of health.
    They sought not happiness, righteousness nor wealth,
    But now they jog along to end of life’s rope,
    The end is not far, just o’er the slope.
    Their lives must be studied
    With their heads bloomed gray
    To direct souls
    Along life’s sweeter way.
    ’Twill teach you their sorrow
    Each day ’twill bring
    The joy that’s in our lives
    ’Twill loudly ring.
    But if heads are hard
    And holds within
    The things you crave
    Be worldly sins
    We’ll go down to a joyless end,
    Leaving sorrow to have its sway,
    We’ll be like those two
    I saw the other day.




        HER SOLEMN THOUGHTS


    Oh! cruel, cruel fate is mine,
    Why am I tortured with life so unkind.
    Cruel as the grave, it means peace for me,
    For there only, my sorrow, will e’er let me be.
    Peace or happiness, I truly know not,
    And gone art the sunshine that lightened my darkened spots
    The little birds for me do not sing so sweet
    And the roses have withered from the warm summer’s heat.
             --_Mrs. Perry H. McGee_




        YOUR EYES AND MY EYES


    Your eyes so beautiful tells a tale
    And o’er me holds the bill of sale.
    With each glance they tenderly bring
    A little love song for my heart to sing.
    They hold the warmth around my soul
    With love, kind love, too sweet to be told.

    Were my eyes allowed to tell
    How my poor heart beats by spells.
    For your love it really craves,
    Why send it down to its grave?
    Time take away my haunted years
    And your love, sweet love, that’s caused me tears.

    Let your eyes shine for me real true,
    Then I’ll explain more love for you.
    The world then would cease my sorrow.
    This brings a brighter day to-morrow,
    Then forever we’d live in sweet loveland
    With love, much love, I’d hold your hand.

    By your eyes I traced your love,
    Being guided by the Savior above;
    I saw a weakening along the way
    That I could strengthen would it pay,
    But those things are hard to mend
    When two has love that doesn’t blend.

    Be careful in your daily walks,
    Because from some source or other there’s always a watching eye.




        NATURAL BORN COLORED MAN


    Sam Jackson was goin’ with a real yallow gal, the one
         that he called his own-side pal,
    But he found she would deceive, she told a friend by
         the name of Stark.
    She could love Sam if he wasn’t so dark;
    This made a discord down town,
    Cause Sam was standing near, and seemed to overhear
         and just then he spoke right up and said:


        CHORUS

    I’m a natural born gen-u-wine colored man, you don’t
         have to look twice to see who I am,
    You look at me once and your thoughts will end, cause
         I got that puro-de colored skin.
    It’s the kind of skin that the sun don’t tan, this makes
         me the king of the sunny land,
    So you go your way but bear in mind I’m what you call
         the puro-de gen-u-wine.

    Now all high yellows to Sam is in vain, he never lets
         them bother his brain,
    And all through his life he’ll letum alone, he knows that
         his skin’s a bit shady,
    So he will avoid every yellow lady, he’s got a club of his own.
    Where all brown skins can meet and have a musical treat
    For every night Sam kindly sings.




        A BLOT ON LOVE


    On comes the future
    And brighter day it brings,
    But prosperity should never bother
    Love in the heart that sings.

        MEMORIES


    Sweet, sweeter, sweetest memories,
    Of my great, greater, greatest days,
    Has come and gone but now returns.
    As I pass the little church door
    My poor heart yearns. It wants you and those golden hours
    That held my sweet, sweeter, sweetest memories.

    When I hear
    The church organ play,
    My poor heart
    Just hums away
    A million of your melodies
    And my sweet, sweeter, sweetest memories.

    All the little birds
    Just seem to know
    Of my happy days
    When you loved me so,
    For every morn they tenderly sing
    My sweet, sweeter, sweetest memories.




        YOU ARE


    You are my morning star,
    You are my evening’s pride,
    You are my all and all,
    You are my love besides.

    You are my brightest hope
    You are my world of gold,
    You are all of my happiness,
    You are ne’er to grow cold.




        GRAY EYES


    Gray eyes, with your haunting, piercing trait,
    And your infernal deadly bliss,
    Around my heart still entwins a kiss.
    Though shame am I to relate.

    Gray eyes, this game fate is ruling,
    Though many are the sad spirits
    That conscience has seen,
    From a lonely bench in the park amid the green,
    With an aching, burning heart
    No thoughts of you were cooling.

    Gray eyes, answer me with your dreamy look,
    Ah! that loving, tender smile’s a traitor,
    Sad reflections we both see,
    The last spark in my heart its took,
    And I have learned to be your hater.

    Oh, dat muddy ’bio,

        JUST AN IRISHMAN’S WAY


    If your name is Mc or O’Maley
    Come and shake hands with me,
    That’s the brand killarney gives
    Before sending us over the sea.
    No words I can speak
    To hold more true
    And to show I’m an Irishman thru and thru,
    Than those that are blending
    To the Irish minds
    Sure Mc or O’Maley
    Is just the time.

    Sure this is an Irishman’s way,
    Though to you it may seem odd;
    But the land they are from is a paradise
    Blessed by the greenest of sod.
    This makes me proud
    Sure to be,
    And to meet an Irishman
    Just like me.
    Then we can tell of the lakes and dells
    And the beautiful shamrock bordered shores.




        OFTEN TOLD


    Oh! the beautiful morning sun
    That shineth on the mistic dew,
    It sparkles different colors
    Once your eyes would do this, too.




        VIOLET AND YOU


    Early in the spring
    Beneath the veranda grew
    A lonely little violet,
    And it brought our love anew
    The days that we were parted.

    My heart was ever true,
    I shall always love this violet,
    This violet and you.
    I’ll pluck this little fellow,
    And to you I’ll tenderly give.

    It’s a token of our reunion,
    May our love always live.
    Though life could give no sweeter, too,
    Than this violet, this violet, and you.

    And I shall hold in memory
    This violet, purple and green,
    For returning life’s happiness
    To me, that’s what it means.
    Though my love it blew and blew,
    Rack to this violet, this violet, and you.




        MY WILL


    I’m slow to anger when trouble comes,
    For this is just my build,
    And to hurt the feelings of another
    Is usually against my will.




        OLEGRIA

        Composed May 27, 1920.


    Around me at twilight shadows fall,
    From the beautiful heavens is a childish call.
    That has haunted me for years and years,
    Through my bitter sighs and salty tears,
                It’s Olegria, my little unseen.

    Ah! there’s my little darling one
    To pay me a visit, at the setting of the sun.
    Be seated here love, on the green sod,
    You’re a little blessing from our own God,
                Olegria, my little unseen.

    Now listen to the dream, of daddy’s golden hour,
    But awakened from his slumber by the down twinkling shower.
    Then I tried to stroke your beautiful brown hair,
    But the breath of a moment banished you into the air,
            ’Twas farewell Olegria, my little unseen.




        IN AN ALL OLD ROSE


    I dreamed you were dressed in an all old rose,
    So sadly I kissed you while my soul was reposed,
    I dreamed that you promised some day you’d be mine.
    I dreamed heaven blessed our love divine,
    Gone art that night to where no one knows,
    But I’ll n’er forget you, dressed in that all old rose.
    You gladden my heart while love breezes blew,
    I know not where my sorrow then flew,
    Maybe into lands where love ne’er grows
    To tell you dressed in an all old rose.




        LOVE’S REFLECTIONS


    If I had wings,
    I’d take you and soar
    To a land of happiness
    For evermore,
    Leaving all sorrows
    To the years we’ve seen,
    Then Cupid can play
    On the grassy greens.
    She’d have no use
    For her bow and arrow.
    Our hearts will be true
    And gay as the sparrow.
    Then we can gaze down
    In that valley so deep
    That held our love
    Before it could creep.

    Entertain no thought other than good,
    Then evilness around you will ne’er prevail.

    An open expression may slip from the lips,
    But deceit constantly dwells within.

    We only receive in value
    The interest in which we do a thing.




        SUMMER IS GONE


    When the leaves have all turned brown
    And through the autumn breeze
    They come sailing to the ground,
    This tells me that summer is gone.

    Left in the garden is one single rose,
    Its a sad token that every one knows,
    Oh! how my heart does sorrowfully swell,
    When that rose begins to tell that summer is gone.

    Now I’ve roamed and tried to find
    Some place to hide my sorrow behind,
    But where’er I go
    Mother nature says so, that summer is gone.

    Where are the little birds
    And their music I heard?
    They fly side by side
    To a place that provides, when summer is gone.

    The beautiful sun’s hidden behind the clouds
    And my poor heart almost speaks aloud,
    To have it return
    It would cease to yearn, but summer is gone.




        IDLENESS


    Idleness from day to day
    Upon the strongest mind bad thought will play
    Around your heart there’s a knocking,
    ’Tis consciousness; then to be idle
    Shows ungodliness.




        A SHADOW ON THE BEAUTY OF LIFE


    When you wear a frown, from day to day,
    Having no regards for the right I’ll say
    Seeking your company without a thought,
    And deafening your ears to what mother has taught,
    This puts a shadow on the beauty of life.

    If there sits before you a glass that bubbles,
    It means you only sorrow and troubles,
    ’Twill take you to the late hours at night
    And start your longing for wonderful sights.
    Then a shadow is on the beauty of life.

    If you ne’er look before you leap
    In trying to get money by the heap,
    To lengthen joy rides in beautiful cars,
    Soon you will land behind the bars,
    This spreads a shadow on the beauty of life.

    If you’re easy persuaded in doing wrong
    Your heart will pay with a little sad song,
    When company isn’t right, travel alone.
    Then ask God to give you a mind of your own,
    And you’ll never shadow the beauty of life.




        HAPPY AND SORROW


    Each happy thought may be followed by sorrow,
    It can steal away your smiles for to-morrow.
    The hours we are happy to our lives means a goal,
    Value happy thoughts for we are fast growing old,
    Walk a narrow path and from happiness borrow,
    For happiness could change in the next hour
    Then sorrow, like rainfall, could pour in showers.




        THE SHAWL OF SIN


    Oh! sinful shawl
    That holds me tight,
    Were you off my shoulders
    I’d be straight from this night.

    My sorrow’s too great
    To e’er be told.
    I being so weak
    And easy to infold.

    You have taken my strength
    And let me fall.
    May this be a lesson
    To us one and all.




        NATURE


    When the sun goes down in the Golden West,
    Night blankets all nature at rest.
    Far in the east, creeps up the silvery moon,
    The night birds then begin to spoon.

    A heart that is a dangerous one
    Is a heart that cannot hold a secret.

    Fate rules, time brings about
    All of God’s blessing that’s in store for us.

    A restful night makes bright the morn,
    This leads on to endless joy
    Making life worth while.




        DEMOCRACY


    War is over, peace is signed,
    Will the colored man be in the place he used to find?
    Well, he really should not for in the war he was true
    And he’s waiting now to see what Democracy will do.
    Stand up! America, you’re the land of the noble and free,
    But you’re letting other countries mention things you ought to see.
    Oh! but we will live in hopes without a thought of feeling blue,
    But remember our little children knows what Democracy ought to do.
    Now to be frank, with you America and other countries know
    Just how you treat the colored man, with that awful old jimcrow.
    We can be intelligent, dressed sufficient, when we walk in,
    As a rule we are grossly insulted on the account of the color of skin.

    I had a dream, America, just a dream of you.
    But I hope it was a nightmare only passing through.
    I saw you in another war, cannons roared, before declared,
    But if I were you I’d stay at home and clean my own golden stairs.
    Oh, but we will praise the Lord, from whom all blessings flow and sing
    And watch that word Democracy, for we know what it ought to bring.

    Give your time and thought
    To the better side of life.




        BREATH OF LOVE


    Moments by moments, hours by hours,
    Your love in my heart just pours in showers.
                    Breath of love.
    Breath by breath, smile by smile,
    May your love bring to my heart no vile
                    Breath of love.
    Word by word, to ease by ease,
    My love is all yours to treat as you please.
                    Breath of love.
    Side by side, hand in hand,
    Pure love, sweet love, will always stand.




        THE CONVICT


    Cling, clang, the anvil rang
    Behind the prison walls a convict sang
    A song of his innocence as he worked away,
    And for keeping bad company this was his pay.

    He was coaxed by mother, sister and brother
    Before the handcuffs came,
    But now he’s clothed in a little striped suit,
    And to face the world again he’s ashamed.

    Life is so short, death sleep is so long,
    Think kind of me now not after I’m gone.

    Steal not from yourself nowadays
    For your work is your boss.




        ALWAYS


    There’s always a look in your eyes,
    There’s always a rose in your smile,
    Could there be a feeling in your heart
    To my life that means worth while.

    There’s always times I long for you,
    There’s always times I feel sad.
    I wonder if those times could be brightened
    To make my poor heart glad.

    There’s always my golden dreams,
    There’s always my thoughts of love,
    And you are a tender blessing dear
    That flowed from the heavens above.

    There’s always a cloudy day,
    There’s always a little sunshine,
    But there would be no cloudy ones
    If you’ll promise to be mine.




        ALL


    All, to our lives is pure sweet love
    All, in a day it can grow,
    All, in a moment it can leave us,
    All, of us don’t think so.

    All, of our thoughts of happiness,
    All, of our smiles in between,
    All, could be dead by tomorrow,
    All, could be love’s saddest scene.

    Our lives are passing ne’er to repass,
    Quoting these words to memory
    Could save your soul.




        FADED LOVE


    Gone art your love, that I once knew,
    It faded like a rose for the want of dew,
    But God bless you, dear,
    From sorrow and care.
    But there lies memories of your faded love.

    Though I’ll go along life’s gay way,
    Plucking the roses of a bright summer’s day.
    Weakened but guided by the Savior above,
    But still there’s memories of your faded love.

    Enchanted in my heart were you so strong
    I never dreamed fate could guide you wrong.
    From the wilderness came the mourn of a dove,
    It knows the sad story of your faded love.

    Onward to me the years may fly
    But not relieved of my tears and sighs.
    Remember I held you with my little golden gloves
    Till the distant times brought your faded love.




        WHERE THE SUN NE’ER KISSED


    Back o’er the mountain
    Where the sun ne’er shines
    Was left a snow drift
    From winter time.
    In this lonely little spot
    Where nothing will grow
    The warm summer winds
    Ne’er melts the snow.




        THE BREATH OF A ROSE


    You have a soul as tender as the breath of a rose,
    Each day my life’s worth living as our love grows and grows,
    There never shone a star as bright, no sweeter words
         could have come to light.

    And there’s a compensation to you life owes,
    For your soul being as tender as the breath of a rose,
    And the coldest night the winter wind blows
    In my heart’s a humming that no one knows.

    My love for you just gently flows,
    While I sit and think of the words to compose.
    May always your soul be tender
    As the breath of a rose.




        THE WILD ROSE


    The little wild rose
    I gave to you
    ’Tis a token of my love,
    Will you be true?

    It was losing its petals,
    For autumn was near,
    But love so humble,
    For you my dear.

    If all through life
    This rose could speak,
    ’Twould strengthen our love
    Should it e’er grow weak.




        A SONG OF A BROKEN HEART


    Just as many days that my heart has broken
    I will count and hold as love’s sad token,
    But just the way my heart is aching
    Some day you’ll love, then you’ll be forsaken.
    You may be happy for a time, in a way,
    But fate will overrule, then you’re sure to pay,
    And when that time comes you’ll sit and look in space.
    In each, and every vision, will be my broken-hearted face.
    Then you will see and solemnly plead
    To have the time shortened, my heart did bleed.
    But remember when you’re playing with the game of love
    You can fool many a body, but think whose above.




        THE END OF LIFE


    Our lives is like a ball of twine,
    Day by day it unwinds,
    As if tied to a reel that you turn and turn;
    This is what every soul should learn.
    Who only knows where the end will appear
    On this tiny little string holding life so dear.
    Above is our judge to handle this case,
    We know not when the time, nor space
    Being numbered in moments, days, hours, and years,
    Save us, Oh! Lord, as the time draws near;
    And when the end cometh its the work of our God
    Then forever we’ll sleep beneath the sod.

    Blessed art the ones
    Whom our Father crowns.
    But lost art the ones
    Whom seeketh and ne’er found.




        A POET’S DARK DAY


    Listen to the humble words
    That a down-hearted poet did write;
    He was in a world of darkness
    And could not see no light.

    His mind was on one person,
    But his soul was somewhat chilled,
    Though he’d smile when spoken to,
    For this was just his build.

    Maybe his mind is traveling,
    Is why he looks in space,
    His heart is loving some one,
    His actions proves the case.

    But soon his thoughts will change
    To sunshine or maybe flowers,
    Then with joy he’ll sit and write
    For hours after hours.

    A poet has many a thought
    That come and go each day,
    He dwells in the land of beautiful scenes,
    Though some are a thousand miles away.

    His sweetest thoughts is tender love,
    His next is the breath of a rose,
    And oh! how the two, gladdens hearts
    When their souls are reposed.

    Drink not of a bottle
    That has sparkling bubbles,
    This habit once formed
    Means a world of trouble.




        MY THOUGHTS OF YOU


    Here are my thoughts
    Of you, little friend,
    As I pass your gate
    And gently look in.

    Your rose-bloomed face
    And tender smile
    To any one living,
    They’re really worth while.

    You always seem gay
    As the days are long,
    In your heart there must hum
    A sweet love song.

    This tells the story
    Just as you look,
    My thoughts of you
    Will be in a book.




        GOOD SPIRIT


    Oh! dwell with me good spirit
    In my heart let there ring
    Love for all of God’s creation
    Flow from my lips when I sing.

    Deep in my heart
    Let joy be known
    And more love for our Father
    Whom sitteth on the throne.

    You have a moment to think,
    And an hour to act, this reversed
    Could mean you harm.




        A POET’S POWER


    Sleep, dearest one, sleep,
    May you dream of bright fond love
    This poem that I write of you
    Is sent from the heavens above.

    And o’er you will soar an angel
    With golden wings, ’twill fan your brow,
    My love for you in heaven’s record,
    Be humble to our Savior for this blessing he allows.

    This angel will guide you o’er
    A path in which you may sin,
    But let our tender thoughts be of each other
    From the beginning to the end.

    At times you may sit and wonder
    Why you want me dear,
    I being born unfortunately poor,
    But the power in my writing holds you near.




        ROUGH ROAD


    My heart beats weak
    But my thoughts strong,
    Jogging up the road to success,
    And my strength has left me so,
    But I never stop to rest.

    We are born in this world
    With burdens laid out
    To shoulder as the years go by.




        A POET’S THOUGHTS


    A poet’s thoughts are as deep
    As the old sad sea,
    And he holds love for his work
    That will always be.

    A joy to his heart
    That comes in dreams, sweet dreams,
    And he’s a humble fellow,
    Just as humble as he seems.

    His heart is very tender
    And this is easy explained,
    For he’s always thinking
    To relieve, some heart of it’s pain.

    Night and day he labors,
    With gift he loves so well,
    And when he’ll ever tire,
    Time, can only tell.




        WHAT WE GET


    The early bird gets the worm,
    The wise man gets the money,
    Jack Frost gets the autumn leaves,
    The little bee gets the honey.
    The working man gets his meals (sometimes)
    The doctor gets his calls
    But what’s the use in worrying, friends,
    The graveyard gets us all.




        HIDDEN THOUGHTS


    Isn’t it hard to drive back your feelings
    When therein shines a smile,
    For the one whom you love so dearly,
    And their life could mean you worth while.

    But drive it back secret love,
    Into a day of darkness and rain,
    You hold the wrath of deep sighing,
    And to our hearts, you bring racking pain.

    It hangs heavily on mind,
    And its stealing what nature has given.
    Oh! why does fate, with this bad omen
    Hold this torturing, in which we live?




        THE BEE AND THE ROSE


    Good bye, honey bee, you gathered from me
    Honey the whole summer long,
    But autumn’s here to take me home.
    Now I’ll lose the sound of your song,
    But go to your nest
    And dream of the past.
    When winter goes by
    Spring returns fast.
    Then I’ll return, too,
    And open my buds,
    Then the loving, tender breeze,
    With my fragrance will flood.




        EASTER GREETING

(To my wife Ruby)


    When I think of the day
    That we’re to part,
    It brings a deep sigh
    That weakens my heart.

    Then it leaves my mind
    So roamsome and blue,
    For there’s my love
    In memory of you.

    In the heart of these roses
    With their petals so gay
    Is my love most tender,
    With each breath they’ll spray.

    Here’s solemn hopes
    With love so true,
    May these roses touch your heart
    Through and through.

    And when their petals wither
    To blow on the breeze,
    Remember love is deeper
    Than any place in the seas.




        A DIFFERENCE


    We are strong in some things
    And weak in another;
    We are not all alike,
    There is a difference in brothers.




        MILDRED AND MARIE


    The night was still,
    No sounds could be heard,
    But soon came voices
    Sweet as a bird.

    I arose from my bed
    To find who it could be.
    ’Twas my deceased sisters,
    Mildred and Marie.

    Oh! how beautiful
    Was their golden wings,
    With music in their voices
    That the living can’t sing.

    They told of the heavens
    So sweetly to me,
    And tell mother you were visited
    By Mildred and Marie.




        LOVE DREAM


    The rose of my life
    Were in bloom it seems,
    When I saw your face
    In my golden dreams.

    It cleansed my thoughts
    So sweet and bright,
    I ne’er wanted to awake
    Out of my slumbers that night.




        SADNESS


    Oh! torturing sadness, why burden me now?
    Hide behind those unhappy thoughts that’s the cause of my broken vow,
    You build around me those death chilled walls,
    Leaving no sunshine in,
    But fate is the cause in letting me fall
    Deep into this untold sin.

    But I’ll take you with a smile,
    It matters not where’er I be
    I’ll stand my ground like a man
    If you’re rough as the water of the mad rushing sea.




        THERE MUST BE


    When we lie down
    On our couch to rest,
    Our conscience must be clear
    To be heavenly blessed.

    Then smile, oh gentle Savior,
    As you pass on into sleep,
    Then somewhere in slumber land
    You may holy creep.

    There your sins are washed away,
    And replaced by golden wings,
    Oh, think what you’ll enjoy
    To hear the heaven’s choir sing.

    Isn’t it hard to give
    Your heart and soul
    For the one you’d die to let live,
    When day by day they are growing cold.




        MY DAILY PRAYER


    Oh, Lord, teach me from day to day
    To dwell in the path
    Along the righteous way.
    Remove my thoughts
    Of riches and gold,
    For this so many
    Have traded their souls.




        THE THOUGHT OF A HUSBAND


    Each moment you frown
    You’re stealing from your life,
    And at times you break the heart
    Of a dear sweet wife.

    One’s greatest fancy is a smile
    And love’s brightest way is hope,
    Then time’s golden entrance is patience.

    Though the years to us may come and go,
    But out of my memory ne’er can flow
    The ring I gave you that spoke in silence
    For you it held you, but for me violence.

    A wicked thought is easy bought,
    But values nothing in gold.
    So read this verse between times,
    And let righteousness into your soul.




        MY LIKES


    I like all nature’s beauty,
    I like to rove the wild wood,
    My heart likes to hold in its depth,
    I like only thoughts that are good.

    True like the sun does shine,
    Aloud like the bells do ring,
    Joy like my heart loves,
    It likes a little song to sing.

    Nice, like a sweet summer’s eve,
    Tender, like the breezes do blow,
    My heart likes to love some one,
    It likes a place to go.

    Who likes a day of sorrow?
    Who likes untold, displeasure?
    My heart likes all happiness,
    And it likes a real full measure.

    I like but a little company,
    I like but a little sight,
    My heart likes to be at ease,
    It likes to feel, what I write.




        TO ALL


    In your heart
    Let silence find a place,
    Then be guided by your conscience
    And you’re always safe.




        UNACQUAINTED


    I’d love to know
    Your real full name.
    ’Twould be pleasure to write
    Your beauty and fame.

    I’d write on the value
    Of you in which I hold,
    Why it could ne’er be bought
    With Rockefeller’s gold.

    Indeed you’re a blessing
    From the heavens above,
    And all would be bright
    If I had your love.

    And while sweet breezes blow
    Over life’s rough way,
    I could sit and write your name
    In my humble essays.




        A SMILE


    Every smiling face,
    Or even jolly motions,
    Doesn’t prove that one’s sorrows
    Are not deeper than the ocean.

    But there is great value, in a smile,
    It can save a poor man’s life,
    When I go home it’s worth while,
    For I meet a smiling wife.




        MOTHER’S DAY


    I received a flower
    On the twelfth of May,
    It was a token
    Of Mother’s day.

    With petals snow-white
    And fragrance so sweet,
    Thou art my hope
    That in heaven we’ll meet.

    My mind wandered back
    In a childish way
    My soul then reposed!
    But seemed to say:

    Oh! the spirit spoke
    As I did pray,
    In the heart of this flower
    Shineth Mother’s day.




        THE BIRDS THAT SING TO ME


    All nature is happy this morning,
    Oh! how they welcome the beautiful sun,
    And those silver-throated fellows
    Gives music until the day is done.

    They bring to my heart so sweetly
    A feeling I can hardly explain,
    That travels on the breezes so tender,
    With such a soothing refrain.




        DREAM OF BYGONES


    The peonies are in bloom,
    Their perfume I adore,
    Naught keeps me from dreaming
    Of you for evermore.

    The night is bright,
    The dewdrops fall,
    The night birds sing
    With a distant call.

    My heart then beats
    In throbbing pain,
    My eyes in tears,
    My soul is strained.

    Come tell me, dear,
    If thy love’s dead,
    Come raise me then
    From sorrow’s bed.




        WHENE’ER CONSCIENCE SPEAKS


    Have you given this a thought,
    If you haven’t you really ought.
    This is what we all should know
    And we do wrong when we don’t go
    Whene’er conscience speaks.

    Every man, woman, or child
    When nearing trouble or something vile,
    Should gently turn
    And never yearn
    Whene’er conscience speaks.




        THE PLUCK OF A POET


    For my little humble talent
    I turn thanks to our God.
    Though each time I try to show it
    I meet with the world of odds.

    Though He blessed me with my gift,
    And He will bless me along the way,
    He is giving me love and wisdom
    And He will bring a brighter day.

    These are words of a poor poet,
    And what I write is true,
    I long to go before the world
    To try and show what I can do.

    If one could only see me now,
    My lips are numb, shows sorrow deep.
    This is after my daily labor
    That these thoughts through my mind does creep.

    God gives me strength to work,
    To earn my daily bread,
    Then revives me for my writing
    To show that my blood is red.

    Why swell up o’er talent
    Or activeness of brain?
    God giveth and he taketh
    As easy as it twinkles down rain.




        LIFE PLAIN AS DAY


    Life lays out its happiness and sorrows,
    You’re to choose either for to-day or to-morrow,
    We can be happy our whole life through
    In regarding our company and the things we do.
    Let the other fellow think what he will or may,
    I’ll choose happiness, it really pays.
    Life holds a beauty that shineth like gold,
    Seek it while you’re young, don’t wait to get old.
    Day by day it comes to us all,
    So fly not so high, remember your fall.
    One moment we’re up and the next we’re down,
    Try to take the ladder without a frown.
    For our lives are planned out with time and space
    And we are truly guided by an unseen face.
    The blossoms of life has petals so dear;
    Then deal with them gently and handle with care,
    There’s like the rose in the garden that blooms,
    That gives to the breeze their wafted perfume,
    But the way the frost makes its petals fly
    This teaches us that we all must die.




        ONE SAD MORN


    In a lonely little village
    Was the tolling of a bell.
    Deep in our hearts
    A sad story it tells.

    Deceased our dear, old general
    Who fought with heart so brave,
    In honor of our land and country,
    And stars and stripes to save.




        MY VIEW


    A poor shabby boy;
    But an ambitious poet,
    And in most appealing way
    He’d love for the world to know it.

    For now he sits and dreams
    Of which he can’t depart,
    And deep in his soul lies
    That beautiful hidden art.

    God gives him the power
    And a clean mind to compose,
    He gathers beauties from an unseen garden,
    Where he dwells when his soul is reposed.

    He has a high standard in thought
    As the richest man of the day,
    And wears a smile, though destitute
    For this is just his way.




        THE FADING ROSES


    Here lies the roses that’s fading away,
    With their memories of a brighter day;
    Just like the heat, are withering them dear,
    The loss of your love brings sorrow and care.
    These roses go back to nature’s review,
    They’ll regain their lives and bloom anew,
    But if my poor heart could be repaired
    With kindness of nature which roses are shared
    ’Twould remove all sorrow and enter sweet refrain
    Then my heart would bud and bloom again.




        FOR A WHILE


    Could there ever be a day
    That sorrow will cease and blow away,
    May it travel to parts to me unknown,
    That my heart have back a feeling of its own
                    For a while.

    My heart has never quit its pining,
    Each thought brings a silver lining,
    And if you were near
    ’Twould ease my care
                    For a while.

    No one knows why I sigh,
    It’s love in my heart that cannot die,
    Though now I regret
    But cannot forget
                    For a while.

    Now it seems like wasted years
    To intermix with my bitter tears,
    Though I’ve prayed to our God above
    That He may return my only love.
                    For a while.

    The beautiful stars in their glory
    Has ceased to tell love’s sweet story,
    They hide from me behind the clouds;
    Will some one love me if my head is bowed?
                    For a while.

    There’s nothing more beautiful than a smile
    If it’s really meant from the heart.




        HEARTS THAT ARE TRUE


    Love when young and tender
    Should pick its place to go;
    Beware of hearts that deceive
    For there, ’twill cease to grow.

    Then hearts that are true
    Beat just as one,
    With a soulful tender feeling,
    Till love’s bright day is done.

    Hearts that are true,
    And when they cross the river of Jordan
    To answer to their rights and wrongs,
    That sweet word love will be in golden letters
    And will be sung in a beautiful song.




        MY LOVE FOR YOU


    How can I forget
    What I have to regret
    When there in my dreams
    It just flows in streams
    And tells a story so true,
    That’s making me feel blue,
    Why it’s my love, my love for you.

    Your eyes, with beauty so rare,
    No diamond could shine as fair.
    But I’ll watch and pray
    For that sweet day in May.
    So return your love anew,
    You have mine and it is all for you.




        MY LOVE


    My work for my race
    Will always be
    Tireless toil
    To make them proud of me.

    Now if we all work
    To this one point,
    Strong will be our union,
    No nation could break the joint.

    Just think! of all of us trying
    To make one another proud,
    Why the little stars in their glory
    Would almost speak aloud.

    Then they’d shine brighter and brighter,
    And with love, they’d light the way,
    For the race that is loving to each other
    There is sure to come a better day.




        EVE DROPPER


    The rose that bloomed
    On veranda side,
    Heard love’s sweet story
    When first untied.

    These hearts traveled
    Through the distant years,
    To join each other
    In their sighs and tears.




        MY DEAR BELOVED MOTHER

    Beside me walks an unseen face
    That guides me daily from place to place,
    And has love for me, like that of no other,
    This guide, tender guide, is my dear beloved mother.

    She goes with me through rain or shine,
    Like the fortunate leads the unfortunate blind,
    And when I am lonely for a sister or brother,
    There’s the cheering thoughts of my dear beloved mother.

    Of course she’s in the spirit land,
    But she walks with me daily hand in hand,
    And when I’m asleep she’s o’er my bed,
    That sin may go no farther.
    Now this teaches us of that mighty love
    We have in a dear beloved mother.




        HIS LAST HOUR

    Oh! mighty Savior,
    Cometh my last day,
    And the sound of the golden trumpet
    My sins bloweth away.

    Glory to thy name
    As I breathe my last breath,
    Repenteth all whom love him now,
    Not at the door of death.

    Each and every moment
    His name to me is all
    Those whom are standing by my dying bed,
    Remember the trumpet’s last call.




        IF I DARE


    I’ll sing a little song
    Of you dear one,
    ’Twill be long as the day
    And bright like the sun
                    If I dare.

    I’ll gather from the garden
    This big red rose
    To kiss your cheeks
    While sweet breezes blow
                    If I dare.

    Your face is ne’er out of my dreams
    Deep in my heart sweet memories bring,
    Oh! I will love you, dear, you only,
    Till death with bitterness bring
                    If I dare.

    My mind is with you
    Though my eyes are in tears,
    My heart is being pierced
    With Cupid’s golden spear,
    But yet I’d return
                    If I dare.

    Oh! how sad with you
    Were my past,
    The present was sweet
    So long as it lasts.




        JUST NOW


    No one knows, and no one sees,
    No one gives my heart any ease,
                    Just now.

    If I could speak to the one I love
    My heart would lose that feeling that makes me mourn like a dove,
                    Just now.

    Once you shadowed me in my dreams,
    But that, too, is gone it really seems,
                    Just now.

    The years are bringing my sorrow fast
    And my wakeful nights won’t come to their last,
                    Just now.




        THE VOICE OF A ROSE


    The rose that spoke
    To her dying soul
    Is the rose ne’er let
    Our love grow cold.

    With each breath
    She’d sigh and say,
    This rose tells me
    There’s a brighter day.

    And when that rose
    Begins to die,
    She’d kiss its petals,
    Then tenderly cry.




        A PHOTO


    If I only had a photo
    Of my happy days
    To hang on this wall of misery,
    That’s weakening my better ways.

    Oh! come, oh! gentle vision,
    Of long, long ago,
    And make that happy picture
    That I once use to know.

    Paint those beautiful eyes,
    That did always shine
    And liven my trembling lips
    That they taught to speak words unkind.

    Why my lips us to part
    With a loving, tender smile,
    But those days are stolen
    That meant me life worth while.




        GOOD FATE


    On a dark and stormy night
    Far ahead shined a little light,
    It was a warning
    With sorrow dawning,
    For the train that approached.
    Fastly into sight
    Towards the bridge that held ill fate
    The flagman awakened but a moment to late,
    For there flowed through a madly stream
    Lifting the bridge clear off its beam.
    All in a moment the engine ran out of steam
    And spying there ahead no light could be seen.
    Speaking to the fireman the engineer said,
    It’s a heavenly blessing our engine ran dead.




        SPRINGTIME


    The birds are singing
    While nature is bringing,
    All of its beauty to show.
    The little wild flowers
    With sunshine and showers
    Are the things that we love so.

    They gladden our hearts
    And strengthen our souls,
    Making life seem young
    To those growing old.

    There’s the beautiful budding
    Of the dogwood trees,
    It’s a shaking and waking
    For the little honey bees.

    To let them know
    That nature brought back
    With a whole summer’s sweetness
    In her blossoms its packed.




        MY HEAVENLY THOUGHTS


    Oh! heavenly Father,
    To our souls give mirth,
    Let dwell with us no evil spirit
    While on this sinful earth.
    Strengthen our weak and humble minds,
    Through our hearts let righteousness flow,
    Keep us away from worldly things,
    For when Thou call we’re sure to go.




        A POET’S PIER


    A humble but ambitious poet
    That writes on the beauties of life,
    Is brilliantly guided onwards
    By the love of his dear sweet wife.

    In each and every thought
    She is truly his golden pier.
    She leads him on to untold success
    Where he enjoys a brighter career.

    Into a garden of roses
    Where soft breezes blow,
    There she’s always near him
    To let his sweeter thoughts flow.

    To her he gathers and gives
    A beautiful big pink rose,
    To show that his love’s still burning,
    And for her it could ne’er repose.

    And when he awakens out of his dreams
    There is music to her ears,
    For all the poems that he writes
    He reads to his wifey dear.




        WELCOME SPRING


    On comes spring
    With its loving breeze
    Soon there’s the budding
    Of the flowers and trees.

    How my heart swells
    When they begin to peep,
    For I know they’re back
    From their long winter’s sleep.




        MY RUBY MONTROSE


    As I sit and dream
    On the water side,
    My mind is traveling
    Like the high rolling tide.
    No matter how fast
    Or where it goes
    With it my thoughts
    Of my Ruby Montrose.

    No matter how dark
    And stormy the night,
    My mind still wanders
    By my strong lovelight
    Holding a secret
    That nobody knows,
    And guided by the thought
    Of my Ruby Montrose.

    Now I’ve gained her love renown,
    The world will smile and cease to frown.
    The summer breeze that always blows
    Will refreshen the love of my Ruby Montrose.
    I ne’er grow tired of the words I write,
    They are my soul and my heart’s delight.
    They hold more sweetness than any flower that grows,
    For in them’s the thought of my Ruby Montrose.




        BEAUTY AND UGLY


    When beauty fades away
    Ugly approaches soon,
    But when ugly fades away
    Our place is lost beneath the moon.




        THE BLESSING OF GOD


    Close not thy door
    To the blessing of God,
    Just e’er be humble
    And spare the rod.
    And when you see a friend
    Downhearted and cold
    Longing for the warmth
    Of a spirited soul,
    Just open the heart.
    Though it may seem odd,
    But to you will come the blessings
    Of our own God.
    No link or links tighter ties
    Than those that are blending to the human lives,
    Quote this to memory to have and to hold,
    And liven up the spirit when you’re grown old,
    And when on earth you’re done
    Then you can rest beneath the sod,
    For your door was always open
    To the blessings of God.




        SIXTY-ONE


    Down on the southern plantation,
    From sixty-one on back
    Our forefathers were shackled in slavery,
    And lived in huts and shacks,
    But this shows they’re loyal
    Hum, a negro as you glance,
    But their grandsons are answering the roll call
    Somewhere in France.




        A VISION FROM THE FIRESIDE


    Before the fire at night
    When all was quite still,
    I had nature’s sweetest dream,
    And its beautiful old green hills.

    Oh! that lovely photo,
    That appeared in the little blue blaze
    Showed summer with all its beauty
    And how the cattle used to graze.

    Then came a sigh,
    Though followed by a smile,
    For the summer’s balmy breeze
    Made me feel like a child.

    But dashed against the window
    The chilly howling winds
    That takes my vision in a snowdrift
    And how my heart does pine.




        THORNY LOVE


    There’s a vision of your well known face,
    Shining like my love that’s gone to waste.
    I see your smiles as natural now,
    And the way I loved you, for you taught me how.
    Now I’m in a path that usually leads
    Down to degradation.
    My poor heart bleeds
    When I think of our separation.




        THE BATTLE OF HEARTS


    Our hearts have met
    On the battlefield of love,
    Cupid is our general
    In his aeroplane above.

    But my poor heart’s
    Crying for peace,
    My love for you
    Could ne’er decease.

    And if fate guides the battle
    So our hearts doesn’t blend,
    Just picture how sad
    Will be the end.




        TO REMIND YOU


    Just a tender missive dear
    As the days are drifting by,
    And oh! I see your smiling face
    When e’er I look into the sky.




        JUST TO REMIND YOU


    Smiles always gladden my heart
    As the years come and go;
    And should I be the longest liver
    They’ll ne’er be buried beneath the snow.

    One day of sorrow
    To a brilliant and happy mind
    Tears down its concrete thoughts
    To sail the ocean of brine.




        THE SINKING SHIP


    The winds howled o’er
    The dashing sea,
    The ship was foundered
    At half past three.
    The captain yelled,
    Life boats lowered!
    There was a noise
    Like a cannon roar,
    ’Twas the boilers burst below.
    Then said the captain
    Brave but slow,
    It’s too late, boys,
    We all must go.




        SPRING’S EASTER LILY

(To my wife Ruby)


    By the walk way grew
    Spring’s Easter lily
    Wet with the morning dew,
    But with love I gave to Billy.

    Now there is your petals nice and yellow
    And rich as the dripping of gold.
    So why are you lonely, little fellow,
    You’ve won me, heart and soul.

    Would you love to be a little present
    And one that isn’t silly
    To the sweetest little pheasant
    My dearest, darling Billy.




        MY SHIP OF THOUGHTS


    Anchored deep in mid ocean
    Are my ship of thoughts,
    I should sail out and get them,
    That’s just what I ought.

    For once they run smooth
    With calmness of the sea,
    Bringing all of love’s beauty
    Back home to me.

    In a mad rushing storm,
    But she would stand as brave,
    When each flash of lightning
    Showed the depth of her grave.

    There’s no lighthouse
    To guide her in,
    Nor to raise her anchor
    From the wages of sin.




        THE SOUL OF A BUD


    A darling little maiden
    So sweet, so fair,
    With tiny dimples
    And beauty so rare,
    But I wonder if goodness knows
    If she e’er could repose.

    From the sweet loving manner
    She gave me this rose,
    Now this tiny little bud
    Seems to whisper in my ear,
    Saying hearts of hearts with tenderness
    To one another are dear.




        ONE’S NEXT BEST FRIEND


    I was lost in the valley
    All veiled with fog,
    Back o’er the hill
    Was a howl of a dog.
    He was doing his bit
    In trying to keep peace,
    For his dear old master
    Had just deceased.
    In that old cabin
    Was a dear little child;
    The wolves rushed around
    Madly and wild.
    On came the morn,
    But I’d grown pale.
    The sun came up and
    Removed the veil.
    Then I jogged along
    O’er the bumpy ground,
    I stopped at this cabin
    And there I found
    A wonderful baby!
    With eyes so bright
    ’Twould light the way
    Through the darkest night.
    From under the bed
    Came a grunt of a hog,
    I knelt and found
    ’Twas that little dog.




        CREATION


    We are all created by our Father above
    And one’s no better than the other
    When we keepeth His command.




        HUMIN TU DE AIR


    Raifield, yo aks like a ole time barh
    Round heah a studen al in despah;
    No Ise humin tu de air.

        IN MY THOUGHTS OF YOU


    Now I sit and look in space
    My brightest hopes has gone to waste,
    The rose of my dreams
    Won’t bloom it seems
    While my mind’s anchored deep
    In my thoughts of you.

    No one knows how my heart does ache,
    No one sees my nights of wake.
    The moon is hidden behind the clouds,
    The stars peep through an all dark shroud
    In my thoughts of you.




        MY DEAREST DARLING RUBY


    Fate had lost my treasure
    In the valley of dehuby,
    Time led on and there I found
    My dearest, darling Ruby.
    All my days I hunted in vain
    Through ice, sleet, snow and rain.
    And on the darkest day,
    This was my pay,
    My dearest, darling Ruby.
    Only death can part us dear,
    If away a moment it seems like a year,
    Life for me would ne’er be bright,
    The stars would fail to shine at night
    Without my dearest, darling, Ruby.




        HERE AND THERE


    Here’s the rose, that bloomed in the spring,
    There’s its petals flying.
    Here’s my heart, that wants your love,
    There like that flower, it is dying.

    Here’s to a day, and its sunshine,
    There to east is a cloud,
    There in a moment, it could hide the sun,
    Here all nature’s heads, will be bowed.

    Here’s my thoughts of yesterday,
    There’s my thoughts of tomorrow,
    Here the ladder shows a brightness,
    There goes sorrow.

    Look on both
    The bright and dark side of life
    And there your faults may be found.




        ONE SWEET DREAM


    In looking way ahead
    Into the distant time
    So beautiful is my thoughts
    If I can make them rhyme.

    Long beside the road
    Is a bungalow for two,
    In my wonderful vision
    ’Twas built for me and you.

    My heart was the hammer,
    My soul clinched the nails,
    ’Twas finished with my love
    To withstand the on coming gale.




        DARLING EDNA MAY

(To Mr. and Mrs. Poindexter)


    How sad was this Christmas,
    Though for some ’twas a happy day,
    But mourns a mother and father
    For their darling Edna May.

    But she’s gone on into glory
    To soar the golden way,
    She knows no sorrow like mother and father
    For their darling Edna May.

    Though on and on through the distant years,
    When mother and father are old and gray,
    Christmas brings saddest memories
    Of their darling Edna May.




        LIFE’S PRETTY WAY


    Oh! how nice
    When the sun is shining bright,
    To take a long walk
    While breezes blow light.

    It revives your soul,
    Your heart is gay
    Strolling the road
    Of life’s pretty way.

    You’ll walk on the grass
    So beautiful and green,
    And gone art your memories
    Of the past winter’s scene.

    You’ll enjoy all the love
    In this bright summer’s day,
    Wandering the road
    Of life’s pretty way.




        RAS BAYLEM’S SPEECH


    Ladies an gentlems, fello citisans, it behooves me wid

        MY DREAM


    I thought I’d forgotten you, dearie,
    But you returned in my golden dream.
    The distant years faded you in person,
    But again you’re fresh in memory it seems.

    Just like the rose wants morning dew,
    That’s how my dream makes me want you.
    Cruel fate and time has drifted us apart,
    I smile on the world, but no one knows my heart.

    Oh! let me dream both night and day,
    That I may dream my sorrows away
    Into a land of passing breeze
    To give my heart one moment’s ease.




        A SAILOR’S FATE


    Lowered deep was the anchor
    As the waves rolled high,
    With thought of loved ones
    Between each sigh.
    This was their minds
    As they gazed into the sky,
    Making peace with their Savior,
    For they knew they had to die.
    Have mercy on us, Lord, as we pray to Thee
    Save us as we’re descending down,
    Let us go not, without the holy ground.

    Glad hearts often
    Through broken hearts ring,
    To teach the voice
    A little song to sing.




        AT EVE


    From behind the clouds
    Peeps the golden sun,
    To kiss the rose,
    Because the day is done.




        SHE SAID. THEN HE SAID THE REST


    Oh! my lovely walk,
    Down love’s shady way,
    The birds soft, sweet singing
    Adds beauty to the day.




        TRUE


    Have you ever stopped to think, my friend,
    Of your simple life from beginning to end.
    It pays us now to pull with strife
    For youth comes but once in life.
    There’s two paths up and down the hill
    To seek one or the other is your own free will.




        CUPID


    The moment I saw
    Your dear sweet face,
    Cupid with its arrow
    Took its place.

    Be not discouraged over life’s hard struggle,
    Have brighter thoughts and discouragement shrugs.




        MY THOUGHTS OF IT


    Love is a link, a connector of hearts,
    Allow no one to tear it apart.
    It’s a food for heart, soul and mind,
    True love is ever blind.




        THE THOUGHT OF A CHILD


    Train your children manners and behavior
    While around the cradle they creep,
    Then good tidings will ever follow them
    After you sleep in the deep.




        A GENIUS


    On yonder hill sits a genius
    In heaven’s guiding hand,
    That pours his thoughts just as he writes
    His power is God not man.




        FOR MY HEART


    When the heart is crippled
    And the soul cannot be raised,
    Just think of dear old mother
    That’s the spark that lights the blaze.




        ROUND RY ROUND


    Just a word of consolation
    While I dream night and day,
    Will help me climb the ladder of fame
    Though the top is far away.




        A THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE


    My heart at times loses a beat,
    But the trouble will ne’er be known,
    For I have that much mother wit
    Each tub has a bottom of its own.

    It’s easy to be good in life,
    But hard to be faultless.

    Good thoughts on the mind
    Should lie deep in the heart.

    So bountifully in, flows the word keep peace.
    Dare not e’er to intrude.

    A man who smiles through the deepest of sorrow
    To his own heart adds a value untold.
